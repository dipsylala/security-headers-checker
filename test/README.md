## UI Testing Features (NEW)

The new UI test suite (`npm run test:ui`) provides end-to-end frontend testing:

### 🖥️ What It Tests
- Server availability and health
- Application page loading
- UI element presence (form, input, button)
- Full analysis workflow (enter URL → analyze → results)
- Results content verification

### 📸 Screenshot Artifacts
- **Automatic capture** at each test stage
- **Saved to**: `test/ui/artifacts/`
- **Naming**: Timestamped (e.g., `01_initial_load_2025-10-09T12-30-45-123Z.png`)
- **Auto-cleanup**: Keeps only last 10 runs
- **Full-page screenshots** for complete visibility

### ✨ Test Stages with Screenshots
1. **Initial Load** - Application homepage
2. **UI Elements** - Form and input validation
3. **URL Entered** - User input captured
4. **Analysis Started** - Loading state
5. **Analysis Complete** - Final results display
6. **Error States** - Any failures captured

### 🎯 Test Target
- **Default URL**: `https://veracode.com`
- **Timeout**: 60 seconds for analysis completion
- **Browser**: Headless Chromium (Puppeteer)

### ⚠️ Prerequisites
- Server must be running (`npm start` or `npm run dev`)
- Puppeteer installed (included in dependencies)

## Server Health Check Features

The comprehensive test runner (`npm run test:all`) includes robust pre-flight checks:

### 🔍 Server Health Check
- Verifies server is running on localhost:3000
- Tests basic connectivity and responsiveness
- **Timeout**: 5 seconds

### 🔍 API Health Check  
- Validates `/api/analyze` endpoint functionality
- Tests with sample request to ensure API is working
- **Timeout**: 10 seconds

### ❌ Failure Handling
- Clear error messages when server is not running
- Helpful instructions to start the server
- Graceful exit with appropriate error codes

## Test Coverage

### 🔒 SSL Certificate Analysis (8 total tests)
- **Basic SSL Tests (4)**: Certificate validation, protocol detection, key strength
- **Comprehensive SSL Tests (4)**: 12-point SSL analysis, vulnerability checks, certificate chain analysis

### 📋 Security Headers Analysis (4 tests)
- Detection of 22 critical security headers
- CSP, HSTS, X-Frame-Options, X-Content-Type-Options analysis
- CORS and modern security header validation

### 🔧 Additional Security Checks (4 tests)
- HTTPS redirect validation
- Mixed content detection
- HTTP methods security analysis
- Security.txt file discovery

### 🧪 Certificate Error Scenarios (6 tests)
- Expired certificates handling
- Hostname mismatch validation  
- Untrusted root CA detection
- Revoked certificate awareness
- Certificate pinning guidance
- Client certificate requirements

### ⚡ Performance & Reliability (4 tests)
- Response time analysis
- Error handling validation
- Network timeout management
- Comprehensive reliability metrics

## Usage Examples

### Quick Development Testing
```bash
# Start server and run comprehensive tests
npm start &
sleep 3
npm run test:all
```

### Continuous Integration
```bash
# The test runner will fail gracefully if server isn't running
npm run test:all
# Exit code 1 if server not running or tests fail
# Exit code 0 if all tests pass
```

### Debugging Specific Features
```bash
# Test only SSL analysis
npm run test:ssl
npm run test:enhanced-ssl

# Test only certificate error handling
npm run test:badssl
```

## Server Requirements

**Required**: WebCheck Validator server must be running on `localhost:3000`

```bash
# Start the server
npm start        # Production mode
npm run dev      # Development mode with auto-restart
```

The test suite will automatically detect if the server is not running and provide helpful guidance.

## Output Format

### Successful Health Check
```
🚀 Starting Comprehensive Integration Test Suite...
🔍 Checking server health...
✅ Server is running on localhost:3000
🔍 Checking API endpoint...
✅ API endpoint is responding correctly
🎯 All pre-flight checks passed - starting integration tests...
```

### Failed Health Check
```
🚀 Starting Comprehensive Integration Test Suite...
🔍 Checking server health...
❌ Server is not running on localhost:3000
💡 Please start the server with: npm start or npm run dev
🛑 Integration tests require the server to be running
```

```

## Best Practices

1. **Always run `npm run test:all`** for comprehensive coverage
2. **Ensure server is running** before running integration tests
3. **Check individual test categories** when debugging specific issues
4. **Monitor test execution time** - should complete in under 45 seconds
5. **Use exit codes** for CI/CD pipeline integration

## Troubleshooting

### Server Not Running
```bash
# Start the server first
npm start
# Then run tests in another terminal
npm run test:all
```

### API Endpoint Issues
- Check server logs for errors
- Verify port 3000 is available
- Ensure no firewall blocking localhost:3000

### Slow Test Performance
- Network issues may affect external website testing
- BadSSL scenarios depend on external service availability
- Consider running individual test categories for faster feedback
